# Bluepill_Mach3_Interface
Adapterboard to use cheap (7â‚¬) Mach3 CNC Breakout Board with Bluepill/Blackpill
You can find it at Aliexpress, search for  "MACH3 Engraving machine 5 Axis CNC Breakout Board With Optical Coupler" or similar.

I want to use it with 3 Axis millingmachine and grblHAL. https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL
